A retail store grants its customers a maximum amount of credit. Each customer’s available
credit is his or her maximum amount of credit minus the amount of credit used.
Write a pseudocode algorithm for a program that asks for a customer’s maximum
amount of credit and amount of credit used. The program should then display the
customer’s available credit.
 After you write the pseudocode algorithm, convert it to a complete C++ program. 


Solutions-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
double maxCredit, creditUsed, availCredit;
cin >> maxCredit;
cin >> creditUsed;
availableCredit = maxCredit - creditUsed;
cout << availCredit << endl;
return 0;
}
