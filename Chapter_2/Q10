The East Coast sales division of a company generates 58 percent of total sales. Based
on that percentage, write a program that will predict how much the East Coast division
will generate if the company has $8.6 million in sales this year. 


Solution-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
 double salesdiv = 0.52;
 double salescomp = 8.6; 
 double division = salesdiv * salescomp;
 cout <<division << " million " << endl;

 return 0;
}
